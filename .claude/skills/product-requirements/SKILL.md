# Product Requirements Gathering

## Purpose

Guide conversations with clients to understand and define product requirements through structured dialogue. Focus on clarifying the product vision, user needs, and business goals without diving into technical implementation details. When clients are uncertain, provide options and templates to help them articulate their needs.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Starting a new product discussion with a client
- Client has an idea but needs help defining it clearly
- Requirements are vague or incomplete
- Client needs guidance on what questions to consider
- Facilitating product discovery conversations

## Conversation Framework

### 1. Product Vision and Core Purpose

Start by understanding the fundamental "why" behind the product.

**Key questions to explore:**
- What problem does this product solve?
- What is the main goal or purpose?
- What success looks like for this product?
- What inspired this product idea?

**When client is uncertain, offer scenarios:**
- "Is this solving a problem you personally experience, or one you've observed in others?"
- "Are you looking to improve an existing process, create something entirely new, or replace an existing solution?"

**Common product categories to guide thinking:**
- Business tools (productivity, collaboration, management)
- Consumer applications (entertainment, social, lifestyle)
- E-commerce and marketplaces
- Content platforms (publishing, sharing, discovery)
- Service platforms (booking, scheduling, matching)
- Data and analytics tools
- Communication tools

### 2. Target Users and Audience

Understand who will use the product and their characteristics.

**Key questions to explore:**
- Who are the primary users?
- What are their characteristics (age, profession, technical skill level)?
- How many types of users are there (e.g., end users, administrators, managers)?
- What is their current situation without this product?
- What motivates them to use this product?

**When client is uncertain, offer user archetypes:**
- Individual consumers vs. business users
- Technical users vs. non-technical users
- Decision makers vs. end users
- Internal team members vs. external customers
- Free users vs. paying customers

**Prompt for user scenarios:**
- "Describe a typical person who would use this product on a regular day."
- "What would make someone choose your product over alternatives?"

### 3. Core Features and Functionality

Identify the essential capabilities the product must have.

**Key questions to explore:**
- What are the 3-5 most important things users need to do?
- What features are absolutely essential for launch?
- What features would be nice to have but aren't critical?
- Are there any features that should explicitly NOT be included?

**When client is uncertain, use prioritization framework:**
- **Must-have:** Product cannot function without this
- **Should-have:** Important but product can launch without it
- **Could-have:** Nice additions for future versions
- **Won't-have:** Out of scope for this product

**Common feature patterns to consider:**
- User accounts and profiles
- Content creation and editing
- Search and filtering
- Notifications and alerts
- Sharing and collaboration
- Payments and transactions
- Reporting and analytics
- Settings and customization

### 4. User Journey and Workflows

Map out how users will interact with the product.

**Key questions to explore:**
- How does a user first discover and start using the product?
- What is the typical flow from start to finish for the main task?
- What happens before and after the main interaction?
- Are there different paths for different user types?

**When client is uncertain, use journey stages:**
1. **Discovery:** How do users find out about the product?
2. **Onboarding:** What happens when they first use it?
3. **Core usage:** What is the main repeated activity?
4. **Advanced usage:** What do power users do differently?
5. **Maintenance:** What ongoing activities are needed?

**Prompt for concrete scenarios:**
- "Walk me through a specific example of someone using this product from beginning to end."
- "What would a user do on their first visit versus their tenth visit?"

### 5. Business Context and Constraints

Understand the business environment and limitations.

**Key questions to explore:**
- Who is the client/stakeholder for this product?
- Are there budget or resource constraints to be aware of?
- What is the timeline or urgency?
- Are there existing systems this needs to work with?
- Are there regulatory or compliance requirements?
- What is the business model (free, subscription, one-time purchase, ads)?

**When client is uncertain, offer business model options:**
- Free with optional premium features
- Subscription-based (monthly/yearly)
- One-time purchase
- Transaction fees or commissions
- Advertising-supported
- Enterprise licensing

### 6. Success Criteria and Metrics

Define what success looks like in measurable terms.

**Key questions to explore:**
- How will you know if this product is successful?
- What metrics matter most?
- What would make you consider this a failure?
- What user behaviors indicate value?

**When client is uncertain, suggest metric categories:**
- **Adoption:** Number of users, sign-ups, downloads
- **Engagement:** Active users, session length, frequency of use
- **Retention:** Users returning, churn rate
- **Business:** Revenue, conversions, customer lifetime value
- **Satisfaction:** User ratings, feedback, support tickets

## Conversation Techniques

### Active Listening and Clarification

- Paraphrase what the client says to confirm understanding
- Ask "why" to get to underlying motivations
- Identify contradictions or gaps in requirements
- Note when requirements conflict with each other

### Providing Structure

When clients struggle to articulate needs:
- Offer multiple-choice options rather than open-ended questions
- Provide examples from similar products they might know
- Break large questions into smaller, specific ones
- Use analogies to familiar products or experiences

### Avoiding Technical Details

Keep the conversation at the product level:
- Focus on "what" not "how"
- Use user-facing language, not technical jargon
- Redirect technical questions to focus on user needs
- Frame discussions around user benefits, not implementation

### Managing Scope

Help clients focus on what's essential:
- Distinguish between launch requirements and future enhancements
- Identify dependencies between features
- Highlight when requirements are expanding beyond original vision
- Suggest phased approaches when scope is large

## Summarizing and Confirming

At the end of the conversation, provide a structured summary:

**Product Overview:**
- Product name and tagline
- Core problem being solved
- Primary value proposition

**Target Users:**
- User types and characteristics
- Key user needs and pain points

**Core Features:**
- Must-have features for launch
- Should-have features for consideration
- Explicitly out of scope

**Key User Flows:**
- Primary user journey
- Critical interactions

**Success Criteria:**
- Key metrics to track
- Definition of success

**Next Steps:**
- What additional information is needed
- What decisions still need to be made
- Recommended approach for moving forward

Ask the client to confirm or correct the summary before proceeding.
